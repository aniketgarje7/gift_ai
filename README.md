## Overview
 Giftai is a gift suggestion app built with Next.js and the OpenAI API. It allows users to get personalized gift suggestions for their friends, family, and loved ones.

## Features
 1.Personalized gift suggestions based on the user's input and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.
 
 2.User-friendly interface with Bootstrap and Framer Motion.
 
 3.Easy to use: simply enter the recipient's name and interests, and Giftai will generate a list of gift suggestions.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
